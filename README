``migration/fabfile.py``

Approach from 

http://activecodeline.com/moving-magento-site-from-development-to-live-server

to move a magento from one location to another coded in *fabric*.

Use ``migration.cfg`` to specify your locations. Double-check
those entries, since we have some destructive commands in here,
which will e.g. wipe out destination directories before placing a new copy.

When configured, just run

    fab migrate:your_configuration_file
    

Prerequisites:

    - python and fabric installed
    - a password-less ssh connection via keys
